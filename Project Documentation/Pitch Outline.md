## Overview

We’ve all been there. You’re playing The Binding of Isaac (the original, because you’re a real fan) and enter a trea
sure room. You spot a new item — your hopes rise as it looks like it could turn your run from great to unstoppable.
But then you pick it up, only to find out it just lowered your HP by 2 hearts, leaving you vulnerable to a single hit. That once-promising run ends abruptly, leaving you frustrated and regretful.

Every BoI player knows that moment of curious excitement followed by crushing despair. My project aims to make that 
a thing of the past by creating a UI application that runs alongside the Binding of Isaac game window. When you 
enter a treasure, angel, or devil room, a dialog will pop up next to the outlined item in the game, displaying its 
effects and a brief description — before you even pick it up.

This basic implementation will be the foundation for continuous updates and quality-of-life features, helping 
players make smarter choices and enjoy the game even more.dates.



## Lay of the land: High level description of what will be designed/built. This often includes additional context needed to understand the finer details in the rest of the pitch. For example, in a pitch about settings, this section might describe how to access the settings page, where it lives in the product, and what the general layout looks like.


## Deep dive: Detailed explanation of an individual area, feature, or event related to the solution. A pitch will likely have many "deep dive" sections to cover everything that is needed. For example, in a pitch about settings, there might be a section about "notifications", "profile" "admin access", "billing", ect..


## No-gos: Anything that is not within the scope of the pitch and should be avoided.  It's helpful to record decisions, even when the answer was "no", for future reference and to reinforce boundaries for the team.


## Product designs: This is where links to the production designs can be added. This section will be left empty at first.
